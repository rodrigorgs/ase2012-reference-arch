	is necessary in order to analyze their strengths and weaknesses in
	comparison to other techniques. For comparable evaluations of automatic
	clustering techniques, a common reference corpus of freely available
	systems is needed for which the actual components are known. The
	reference corpus is used to measure recall and precision of automatic
	techniques. For this measurement, a standard scheme for comparing
	the components recovered by a clustering technique to components
	in the reference corpus is required. This paper describes both the
	process of setting up reference corpora and ways of measuring recall
	and precision of automatic clustering techniques. For methods with
	human intervention, controlled experiments should be conducted. This
	paper additionally proposes a controlled experiment as a standard
	for evaluating manual and semi-automatic component recovery methods
	that can be conducted cost-effectively},
